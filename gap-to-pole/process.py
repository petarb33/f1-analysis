def get_quali_data(session_data: Session, drivers: List) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Extract qualifying lap data from a given session (Qualifying or Sprint Qualifying).

    This function returns a DataFrame containing the lap time that secured each driver's 
    final grid position, the qualifying phase in which the lap was set (Q1/Q2/Q3), and 
    the time gap to the pole position lap.

    Note: This function does NOT return each driver's fastest lap in qualifying, 
    but rather the lap that determined their final grid position.

    Example:
    If LEC (Charles Leclerc) sets a 1:15.000 in Q2, but later sets a slower 1:16.000 
    in Q3 and qualifies P3, then the Q3 lap (1:16.000) will be taken â€” because that 
    is the lap that earned him that grid spot.

    Parameters:
        session_data (Session): FastF1 session object containing session information.
        drivers (List[str]): List of driver abbreviations to include in the result.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: DataFrame with the following columns:
            - Driver (str): Driver abbreviation.
            - LapTime (float): Best lap time in seconds.
            - Session (str): Qualifying phase in which the time was set (Q1/Q2/Q3).
            - GapToPole (float): Time difference to the pole lap in seconds.
